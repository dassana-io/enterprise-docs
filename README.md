# Enterprise Docs

These docs are built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```
$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Using the docs

Each top-level section of the doc corresponds to a service. When you add markdown files, you will need to also configure sidebars.js for your page to show up in the doc navigation.
