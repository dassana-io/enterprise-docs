# Tokens

## What are Dassana Tokens?

Dassana tokens are used for authentication with Dassana's ingestion endpoint.

## How many tokens can I have?

Accounts are limited to two tokens, which can be activated and deactivated in the console (note that activation may take up to 5 minutes to take effect).

import LimitIncrease from '../shared/limit-increase.md'

<LimitIncrease />

## How do I use them?

Include your token as part of a `"x-dassana-token": "YOUR_TOKEN"` header. You can find examples [here](./events/custom). Failure to include a valid token will result in a `token_validation_error` from the ingestion endpoint.

## How should I secure them?

You should treat Dassana tokens as secrets and follow your organization's best practices regarding secret management. If a token is compromised, you can disable it in the console.
