# ðŸ“± Sources

Sources are the entry point for all of your data into Dassana's security data lake. There are three types of sources:

1. Assets - Integrated asset inventories that readily work with Cloud Platforms using APIs
2. Events - Raw data like CloudTrail, VPC flows and more to enrich and contextualize findings
3. Findings - Alerts created by CSPM tools, vulnerability scanners, SCA tools, IDS and more

Each source corresponds to a specific data source / model. Say, for example, you were interested in getting AWS CloudTrail data into Dassana. Upon clicking the source, you will notice multiple mechanisms through which you can get data into Dassana.
