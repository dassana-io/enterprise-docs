# Apps

Each app corresponds to a specific data source / model. Say, for example, you were interested in getting AWS CloudTrail data into Dassana. Upon clicking the app, you will notice multiple mechanisms through which you can get data into Dassana.

Instead of listing out each app here, we have instead opted to organize the documentation based on ingestion mechanisms. There are only a few ingestion mechanisms shared by many apps. Rest assured, if you like a particular mechanism you can use it across many apps!
