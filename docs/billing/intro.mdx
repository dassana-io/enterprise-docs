Dassana partners with Stripe for simplified billing. All you need to do is add a valid credit card and then Dassana will bill you monthly.

:::info What happens if a payment is missed?
If a payment is missed, you will have 7 days to update your credit card after which the account will be suspended. When an account is suspended, all data ingestion and querying is paused. As soon as the payment issue is resolved, all services will resume again.
