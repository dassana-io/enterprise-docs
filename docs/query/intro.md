# ðŸ”Ž Query

Once you have some data ingested into Dassana's cloud lake, you can start writing some SLQ to query the data. SLQ is similar to SQL, with some added sauce, so no need to learn yet another query language! ðŸ˜…

:::tip Example

```
select * from aws_cloudtrail
```

The schema `aws_cloudtrail` is simply the app id set in the [App Store](../app-store/intro).

You can learn more about SLQ [here](./SLQ)

More sample queries are available [here](./sample-queries)
