# ðŸŒŽ Org Manager

The org manager is where you can

-   Create your teams (and subteams) and add relevant users
-   Assign asset containers to teams for proper asset attribution
-   Set asset criticality and whether or not an asset is in production

import AssetContainer from './asset-container.md'

<AssetContainer />
