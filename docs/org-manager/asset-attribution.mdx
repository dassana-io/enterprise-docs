# Asset Attribution

Dassana makes it very simple to figure out which team owns what assets. Once your [sources](../app-store/intro) start sending data to Dassana, the data gets normalized. One of the critical pieces of information that is normalized is the asset container.

import AssetContainer from './asset-container.md'

<AssetContainer />

Once you have created your [teams](./team-management), you can start assigning asset containers to them. By assigning asset containers to teams, all assets and their relevant findings are assigned to the team in question.

You can even set the criticality of the asset container (critical, high, med, low, unspecified). Furthermore, you can set whether or not the asset container in question is in produciton. The criticality and is prod attributes are inherited by the assets in the asset containers.

:::info Need even more granular asset attribution

This is something that is in the works and will be available very soon
