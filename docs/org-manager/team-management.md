# Team Management

## Teams

An organization consists of teams. You can create teams (and subteams) to mimic your organization's business units and their further subdivisions.

There is one admin team which has visibility and controls over the entire organization. Think of this as the central security team. They have the permissions to do everything. However, subteams cannot be added under the admin team.

## Users

### Team Owners

Every team has a team owner. The first user added to a team automatically becomes it's owner.

### Team Members

Every other member of a team is a team member.

:::info Subteams

Say we have team `Scranton` which has the the subteams `Sales` and `HR`. Any member of the `Scranton` team can see all the data of the children teams `Sales` and `HR`.
